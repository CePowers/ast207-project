# Scientific Evidence For Black Holes

## What are Black Holes?
Black holes are objects where the matter is packed so densely together and gravity is so strong that the escape velocity within the event horizon is faster than the speed of light, so no light can escape.

## Observations
Since no light can escape from a black hole, they appear completely dark in the night sky which makes it impossible to directly observe them. However, there are several observations that suggest the existence of black holes.

The main way to observe a black hole is to observe the material around it. The material around a black hole, called an accretion disk, gives off a lot of radiation, especially x-ray radiation, which can be observed through telescopes. There has even been an image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope where you can see bright material with a dark spot in the center. This image was released in 2019 and is the center of the M87 galaxy.

This image is relatively new, so before an image like this could be captured there were other observations that led astronomers to believe in the existence of black holes. One of these observations is Tidal Destructive Events or TDE. These events occur when a star is ripped apart by a black hole. These appear as large flares of light that can be observed in the optical, ultraviolet, and x-ray spectra.

Another way to observe black holes is to observe the motions of the stars around them. For example, in the video from ESO below you can see the star S2 orbit around what appears to be an invisible mass.
